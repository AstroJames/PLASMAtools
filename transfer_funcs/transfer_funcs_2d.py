        Initialize the transfer analysis class with the necessary parameters.

        This class handles the setup for calculating energy transfer between 
        different fields (e.g., magnetic, velocity) in a fluid simulation. It 
        reads the necessary data fields from files, sets up the wavenumber grid, 
        and prepares the bins for subsequent calculations.

                            to be read (default: "Turb_plt_hdf5_0010").

        Create logarithmic bins for the transfer analysis based on grid resolution.

        This method calculates logarithmic bins to be used for binning the transfer 
        functions. The number of bins is determined by the resolution of the grid (`self.nx`) 
        and is based on an approach used in Philip Grete's transfer function code. The 
        calculated bins are stored in `self.K_bins` and `self.Q_bins`, and the number of bins 
        is updated in `self.n_bins`.

        Workflow:
            1. The method calculates an exponent (`resolution_exp`) based on the grid 
            resolution (`self.nx`) to determine the range and number of bins.
            2. Logarithmic bins are created using this exponent, starting from 1 and scaling 
            by powers of 2. These bins are stored in `self.K_bins` and `self.Q_bins`.
            3. The number of bins (`self.n_bins`) is updated to reflect the number of bins 
            created, which is the length of `self.K_bins` minus 1.

        Returns:
            None: The method does not return any value. Instead, it updates the attributes 
                `self.K_bins`, `self.Q_bins`, and `self.n_bins`.

            https://github.com/pgrete/energy-transfer-analysis.
            - The calculated bins are suitable for logarithmic binning in energy transfer 
            analysis, particularly in simulations with grid-based data.

        Workflow:

            the corresponding wavenumber calculation:
            - 'iso': Computes the isotropic wavenumber magnitude (sqrt(kx^2 + ky^2 + kz^2)).

            2. It checks if `self.direction` is valid. If not, a `ValueError` is raised.

            have been initialized.
            - The number of bins is determined by `self.n_bins`, and the bins are created using

        Extract and return the inverse FFT of a specific shell of a vector field.

        This method extracts the components of a vector field that fall within a 
        specified wavenumber shell, defined by the range `k_minus_dk < k < k_plus_dk`. 
        The shell is selected based on the direction specified in `self.direction` 
        ('parallel', 'perp', or 'iso'), and the inverse FFT of the filtered shell 
        is computed and returned.
        
        Author: James Beattie & Anne Noer Kolborg

        Args:
            vector_field (np.ndarray): The input vector field to be filtered and 
                                    transformed. It is assumed to be a 3D field.
            k_minus_dk (float): The lower bound of the wavenumber shell.
            k_plus_dk (float): The upper bound of the wavenumber shell.

        Returns:
            np.ndarray: The inverse FFT of the filtered vector field, limited to 
                        the specified wavenumber shell.

        Raises:
            Assertion error: If the input vector field is not 3D.
            ValueError: If `self.direction` is not recognized. Valid options are: 
                        'parallel', 'perp', 'iso'.

        Workflow:
            1. The method first determines the type of filter to apply based on 
            `self.direction`. The filter type is either 'parallel', 'perp', 
            or 'iso', corresponding to different wavenumber components.
            2. It then creates a mask using the filter, selecting the wavenumbers 
            that fall within the specified range (`k_minus_dk` to `k_plus_dk`).
            3. The vector field is transformed into Fourier space using `fftn`.
            4. The mask is applied to isolate the desired wavenumber components.
            5. The inverse FFT (`ifftn`) of the masked field is computed and returned.

        Example:
            # Example usage to extract a shell and compute the inverse FFT:
            filtered_field = self.extract_shell_X(vector_field, 0.5, 1.5)

        Notes:
            - The method assumes that `self.kx`, `self.ky`, and `self.kz` have been 
            initialized and correspond to the wavenumbers of the grid.
            - The extracted shell is in the form of a 3D numpy array, and the output 
            is also a 3D numpy array representing the spatial domain.

    def read_and_save_results(self) -> None:
        """
        Aggregate individual transfer results from files and save the combined results as a .npy file.

        This method reads individual transfer function results from text files in the specified 
        results directory, aggregates them into a single dictionary of numpy arrays, and then saves 
        this aggregated data as a .npy file. Each numpy array in the dictionary corresponds to a 
        specific transfer component (e.g., Tbb_a, Tbb_c) and is indexed by the bin pairs (K, Q).

        Workflow:
            1. The method constructs the path to the results directory and the filename for saving 
            the aggregated results.
            2. It initializes a dictionary `txx_dict` where each key corresponds to a transfer 
            component (e.g., Tbb_a, Tbb_c), and the value is a numpy array with a shape based 
            on the number of bins (`self.n_bins`).
            3. It iterates over all files in the results directory, identifies the relevant files 
            based on the direction (`self.direction`), and reads the data from each file.
            4. For each relevant file, the method extracts the bin indices (idx_K, idx_Q) and 
            updates the corresponding positions in the numpy arrays within `txx_dict`.
            5. After all files have been processed, the method saves the aggregated data dictionary 
            as a .npy file with the specified filename.

        Returns:
            None

        Example:
            # Example usage to read and save the results:
            self.read_and_save_results()

        Notes:
            - The filenames in the results directory are expected to follow a specific pattern where 
            the first part of the filename indicates the direction (`self.direction`). Only files 
            matching this direction are processed.
            - The saved .npy file contains a dictionary where the keys correspond to transfer components 
            (e.g., Tbb_a) and the values are numpy arrays of shape `(self.n_bins, self.n_bins)`.

        Side Effects:
            - The method saves the aggregated transfer function results to a .npy file in the specified 
            `write_path` directory.
